Machine Learning Project: Comparative Analysis of Classification Algorithms

During my 5th semester in BTech, I undertook a project to evaluate the effectiveness of four prominent machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Neural Network. The objective was to identify the optimal model for a classification problem by comparing their performance across key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and error rate.

Key Highlights:

Implemented and fine-tuned KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Neural Network algorithms.
Utilized a comprehensive dataset to train and test each model.
Evaluated performance metrics to determine the best-fit algorithm for the data.
Visualized results using informative pie charts to illustrate comparative performance.

Outcome:

Identified (Decision Tree) as the most suitable algorithm based on rigorous evaluation criteria.
Presented findings in a detailed report, encapsulating methodology, results, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
This project not only enhanced my proficiency in machine learning techniques but also reinforced my ability to analyze and communicate complex data-driven insights effectively.
